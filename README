NAME
    Perl::Metrics::Simple - Count packages, subs, lines, etc. of many files.

DESCRIPTION
    Perl::Metrics::Simple is far simpler that Perl::Metrics.

    Perl::Metrics::Simple provides just enough methods to run static
    analysis of one or many Perl files and obtain a few metrics: packages,
    subroutines, lines of code, and cyclomatic (mccabe) complexity of the
    subroutines and the "main" portion of the code.

    Installs a a script called countperl.
