 Better documentation about measuring complexity.

0.031 - Thu Dec 14 09:05:15 PST 2006
 Fixed bug in the  countperl  script. Was reporting the median instead
 of mean for the summary complexity numbers.
 Thanks to Ovid for spotting this.

0.03 - Sat Dec  2 09:01:41 PST 2006
 The "main" stats for each file now have the same format as the stats for
 a subroutine: Added 'name' and 'path' keys to the hash.
 The 'name' is always:     {code not in named subroutines}

 Changed the 'countperl' script to use the new data structure to add
 the {code not in named subroutines} to the list of subroutines it reports.

 Line counts now exclude blank lines, comments and pod.
 Complexity counts now will be 0 (zero) for code that is only comments/pod.
